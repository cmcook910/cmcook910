Hello! My name is Collin Cook, and I am a recent graduate from the Ohio State University.

With a BS in Statistics and a Minor in Economics, I have spent many hours coding with R, and have also taken courses in SAS and Java, and some posted projects are from previous schoolwork.

In the constantly changing world of Big Data and Analytics, I want to keep learning new skills and post projects here. To start off, I am getting the feel for Python, Tableau, and SQL.
